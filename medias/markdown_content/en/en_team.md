# Our Team

We're proud to introduce our team, which brings together two enthusiasts who came back from a world tour of coffee too long ago.  

### Laetitia Natali [ Boss & coffee roaster ]

In 2015, a few years after her world coffee tour in 2007-2008, Laetitia gave up her career in graphics production to take up coffee roasting. Naturally, she named her brand 'Café 366', for the 366 days of this marvellous journey, and her company Buna Bet, which means 'house where coffee is drunk' in Amharic (the language of Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee).
This world tour led her to discover some of the great coffee-producing countries, including Ethiopia, Yemen, Colombia, Guatemala, Kenya, Indonesia... There she met all the precious people who grow this magical little bean. It was only natural that when she launched her artisan roasting business in 2015, and then opened her boutique in 2023, she should pay tribute to them by roasting with great care and sharing with you the local coffees of all these countries, produced by passionate people.

### Stanislas Marçais [ henchman ]

He is the companion of the new flower of the rue de Meaux, the man with whom she has travelled the world of coffee for 366 days. He's her graphic designer, her artist, her stage manager, her coder and now her Baristan!

Together, they form a dynamic and helpful duo ready to serve you the best coffees.
