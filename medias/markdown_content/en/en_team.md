# Our Team

We're proud to introduce our team, which brings together two enthusiasts who came back from a world tour of coffee too long ago.  

## Laetitia Natali [ Boss & coffee roaster ]

Long before his coffee world tour, it was pixel-perfect graphic production. Then there was the famous journey that led to the germination of a seed, or rather a coffee bean that grew for years next to a roaster. With him, she sweated water to always produce the best beans with the most beautiful aromatic profile to sell to professional customers, but also to individuals at the Pré Saint-Gervais market. Today, this bean, which has become a fine cafeier over time, has given 102 rue de Meaux a new flower by opening its first boutique, your Buna Bet.
PS: Perhaps you know how to translate "new flower" in Ethiopian?

## Stanislas Marçais [ Good fellas ]

He's the companion of the new flower of rue de Meaux, the man with whom she's traveled the coffee world for 366 days. He's her graphic designer, her artist, her stage manager, her coder and now her Baristan!

Together, they form a dynamic, helpful team ready to serve you the best coffees.
